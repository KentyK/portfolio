          <p class="work-detail">People’s awareness regarding malnutrition is a major issue in many countries. According
            to Global Disease Risk 2013 Collaborators, 11.3 million deaths per year attributed to malnutrition. Though
            there are many policies targeting diet such as information campaigns and more recently, series of
            interventions changing food labels to encourage consumers make healthy choices, studies show that long term
            changes are difficult to achieve. We introduce KomaFLens, an app built for Microsoft HoloLens, that aims to
            motivate dietary habit modification through gamification, a behavior modification technique. The goal of
            this project is to motivate the user to make healthier choices in their diet.<br>
            <br>
            Sensing: Lifelogging<br>
            Users can record what they ate by taking a photo of the food label using the built-in camera. The photo is
            then sent to Microsoft Azure Computer Vision API to extract text using OCR from the label. The returned
            value is then parsed and saved locally according to essential nutrient data such as energy, sodium, fat,
            etc.<br>
            <br>
            Processing: Nutrient Diet Score<br>
            KomaFLens adopts and utilizes “Japanese Food Guide Spinning Top”. The nutrient score is assessed based upon
            5 rating categories: grain, vegetable, fish and meat, milk, and fruits. The app sorts user’s food records by
            categories and calculates each point. The ideal index of each category is estimated on the basis of body
            weight and height.<br>
            <br>
            Actuation: Displaying the Top<br>
            KomaFLens displays the spinning top as a holographic object. By visualizing the layers according to the
            nutrient score, user can easily interpret which category he/she is lacking or overconsuming.<br>
            <br>
            Behavior Modification: Gamification<br>
            Another significant feature implemented in KomaFlens is the battle function. When 2 KomaFlens users come
            into close proximity the battle begins. 2 tops collide and compete with each other to spin longer. Users
            will air-tap and shoot missiles to knock out the opponent’s top. The top that falls indicates a less
            balanced meal, while the winning top signifies a healthy diet. The primary purpose of this project is to
            encourage people to be food conscious and to promote awareness for healthy lifestyle. Appealing to the
            visual senses using HoloLens and gamification is an effective way to impact mindful eating for wellness.</p>
